Image encryption method using bitwise XOR combined with nonlinear mapping of chaotic systems


This work first uses bitwise XOR operations to implement image encryption and decryption processing, and then designs a graphical operation interface to allow users to use this image encryption and decryption program, and then analyzes this algorithm to select plaintext attacks and unique attacks. The security of ciphertext attacks is then analyzed, and the current research status of image encryption is analyzed. Finally, a new image encryption algorithm is proposed based on the chaotic system.
